Give Rise Crowdfunding Platform

STATUS: IN PROGRESS
Responsiveness:  In Progress (Best viewed in 1980)

To be candid, I'm currently in a Creative Director and my day to day has evolved past doing extensive coding, design & production work.  That being said, I am eager & it is my goal to jump back in to daily production work at my next position.  For this reason, I do not have an extensive non-corporate public Github.  I set up a quick Github for the purpose of this position & have committed the code of a side project I'm currently working on.   I'm currently in the midst of creating a Progressive Crowdfunding Platform to support activists while they are in the field.  It's very much a work in progress & would like whomever is reviewing it to note that.  It's a good gauge on what I can deliver from an all-in-one strategy, design & engineering perspective.  Most of this project was done straight in code with a few more complex elements done as complete mock-ups.   If you need a more complete project feel free to let me know, but I felt this project demonstrated my abilities the best in relation to the Action Networks goals.

Join Existing Protest:  https://giverise.roundrobinstudios.com/join-protest/ (this works to join an existing protest, dummy-data is in place)
Create a New Protest: https://giverise.roundrobinstudios.com/create-protest/ (in progress but the UX/UI foundation is complete)

Protest Page: https://giverise.roundrobinstudios.com/protests/kyle-aikens-verizon-protests-for-net-neutrality/ (most of this is placeholder/test data but the UX is 90% done including the support/donation form)

Hopefully this user flow is enough to get an understanding of what I'm creating & will demonstrate the value in strategy I can bring that exceeds just design & engineering.  My passion for progressive politics is something that is only outmatched by my passion for digital.

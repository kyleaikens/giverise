Give Rise Crowdfunding Platform

You'll have to excuse the construction as much of it is still in progress & I've primarily been focusing on the wordpress integration and frontend/design to this point.   It's best viewed on a 1980/desktop monitor, since responsiveness has not been completed yet.   It's a pretty good gauge on what I bring from a design/engineering perspective and encompasses some of the trends you referenced on the call such as micro-animations.  Most of this project was done straight in code with a few more complex elements done in mock-ups.

Homepage:  http://giverise.roundrobinstudios.com/  (Sign up & Login work)
Join Existing Protest:  https://giverise.roundrobinstudios.com/join-protest/ (this works to join an existing protest, dummy-data is in place)
Create a New Protest: https://giverise.roundrobinstudios.com/create-protest/ (in progress but the UX/UI foundation is complete)
Confirmation Page:  https://giverise.roundrobinstudios.com/create-confirm/ (various UI elements to share socially)
Protest Page: https://giverise.roundrobinstudios.com/protests/kyle-aikens-verizon-protests-for-net-neutrality/ (most of this is placeholder/test data but the UX is 90% done including the support/donation form)

Hopefully this user flow is enough to get an understanding of what I'm creating & will demonstrate the value in strategy I can bring that exceeds just design & engineering.
